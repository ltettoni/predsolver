Solving against memory or database:
- not in the predicates
- but in the Provider or in the Solver?
  - in the Solver
    - the data source is in the Solver
      gd3Solver.solve(committee(Com))
  - in the Provider
    - the data source is in the provider
      pred = gd3Provider.committee(Com)
      commonSolver.solve(pred)

Combine AND and OR to see if it still works...
-> seems OK so far

Combined (hierarchical) AND does not work!!
-> fixed

Bridge cannot distinguish if there's no var, an unbound var, or a bound var without solution (empty)
  (happens in And: when ANDing 1,2 with 3,4 we have no records, and checking for X tells it's free...)
-> fixed: vars tracked now

See how to simplify the implementation of binary operators by specifing forward and reverse functions.
-> done

Extend solve() to really solve for Tuple2, Tuple3 (at least)
-> done

Repackage (api vs. impl), and source vs. test resources. 
-> done (to some extent)

Predicates of arity/0 ? (boolean)
-> done true, fail

Design and code the DB predicates (SqlBuilder et al)
  jdbc:derby:C:\GIT\logic2j\src\test\db\zipcodes1\derby-v10.8.2.1


Comparisons (ge, le, gt, lt, eq, ne). Note: these are not generators, only filters.

Code some real use cases involving, application, session, conversation, and DB scopes.

Avoid using Term to instantiate predicates. Split data predicates to using Binding, and logic operators by using Predicate

Refactor "Record" to not use a Map, but an array.


Integration with Logic2j or an inference engine?
